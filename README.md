# splash
Unix Splash Screen Tool - turn your desktop into a 2D / 3D canvas

Made in C/C++ + XLIB

See below for distro / DE compatbility

## Description
splash is a generic tool that provides a command-line interface for rendering non-windowed raw data directly onto your desktop environment.

splash transforms your entire desktop into a 2D / 3D canvas, for dynamic data or simple static overlays that can interact with your mouse and keyboard and trigger commands.

Example of splash rendering truetype font text, with a bunch of options, in the foreground on the desktop.

This was originally written because I wanted to have a custom "splash screen" like those fancy, super expensive software packages have when starting up, with transparency and everything. Now it supports a full OpenGL context.

## Usage

Splash requires specification of an execution mode.

    Reading:
      []      Required
      <>      Optional

    <data |> splash [mode] <options/flags>

    Modes (built-in):

      help      Display help message

      fidget    Display a 3D fidget spinner (lol)
      <data>:   None

      img       Display .png image
      [data]:   Image file name

      gif       Display .gif image
      [data]:   GIF file name
      Note:     Only works for full replacing gifs!

      text      Render truetype text (static)
      [data]:   Text to render

    Options:

      -p [x y w h]  Position Splash Quad
      -t [s]        Splash timeout in seconds (integer)

    Flags:

      --t     Test configuration file
      --v     Verbose mode

      --bg    Place splash in background
      --fg    Place splash in foreground (default)
      --ni    Splash no-interact
      --ns    Disable splash shadows (compton)
      --a     Display splash on all desktops

Program specific flags:

      text

      -ff [font]    Font face (searches in ~/.fonts/, default "arial.ttf")
      -fc [hex]     Text color (hex code, e.g. 0xFFFFFF)
      -fs [size]    Font size, positive integer
      -v  [0,1,2]   Vertical Align [center, up, down]
      -h  [0,1,2]   Horizontal Align [center, left, right]

### Examples
Check the `/testdata/` folder for example programs to splash some data onto your screen.

      #Default desktop fidget spinner (no shadow, foreground)

        splash fidget -p 710 290 500 500 --ns --fg

      #Animated SMB wallpaper gif (no interact, all screens, no shadow)

        echo "smb.gif" | splash gif -p 660 340 600 400 --bg --ni --a --ns

      #Display an Image (with shading, blocks mouse input)

        echo "image.png" | splash img -p 360 140 1200 800

      #Display some text on your background

        echo "splash" | splash text -p 100 100 800 400 --bg --ns  -ff "arial.ttf" -fs 100

## Installation

### Dependencies

    Compiler:         g++
    Rendering:        OpenGL, glX, GLEW
    X-Server:         X11, Xfixes, Xrender
    Boost:            boost, boost_system, boost_filesystem

All of these should be available as packages for your favorite distro.

### Setup

Run the script `setup.sh` **with privileges**.

The script will make sure that the required directories exist and will setup splash at `~/.config/splash`.

The script will also ask if you wish to compile splash and the execution modes.

The execution modes are placed in `~/.config/splash/exec` and splash is placed in `/usr/local/bin`.

#### Manual Compiling

If you wish to compile manually, use the makefiles in `splash/Makefile` and `program/Makefile`:

    ./splash:
      make splash

    ./program:
      make [mode]
      make all

Note that splash is separate from the actual execution modes. Execution modes are compiled separately (linked at runtime by splash).

#### Compilation Issues

If you have problems with compiling search the closed issues to see if there is a solution and otherwise feel free to open a ticket.

Common problems might include: Incorrect linking in the make files, because your distro places libraries in a different location, and slightly different names of the libraries in `#include` directives.

## Compabitibility / Requirements / Configuration

This is just from some basic tests I can run on my computer. If you can compile / test on other distros and DEs, please open an issue so I can add it here.

Distros:

        Ubuntu 18           Compiles successfully
        Arch / Manjaro      Compiles successfully (see issues)
        ...                 feel free to open an issue for your distro!

Desktop Environments:

        Gnome / Ubuntu      Works fully
        Openbox             Works fully
        XFCE                Works fully
        bspwm               Works fully (requires config, see below)

        i3                  *Restricted (see below)*
        i3-gaps             Not tested

        ...                 Feel free to open an issue for your DE!

**Note**: Some WMs require additions to their config (see below)

*Sidenote*: The various degrees of compatibility depend on how strictly the window manager conforms to the X11 extended window manager hints specification ([EWMH](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html)). Particularly tiling window managers don't adhere entirely, making it more difficult to produce consistent splash behavior. There are work-arounds using the WM configs.

### Splash xprops
Splash will spawn an X window with a number of additional properties that your WM / compositor / other programs can target to get expected visual behavior:

      SPLASH_SHADOW = [0,1]       set to 0 if --ns is set (1 by default)
      WM_CLASS = SPLASH           for every window spawned with splah
      WM_NAME = SPLASH

**Note**: You might want shadow on for a splash for e.g. an image overlay.

### Compositor config
To enable shadow toggling, add the following rule (or similar) to your compositor config (e.g. `~/.config/compton.conf`):

    #Enable shadow toggling
    shadow-exclude = [
      #...
      "_COMPTON_SHADOW_OFF@:32c = 0",
      #...
    ];
    #...__

If you don't add this the compositor **will always** shade splashes, and it can't be deactivated with `--ns`.

Other compositors (check where to set shadow exclude rule):

[Picom](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Picom)

**Note**: Other compositors might support features such as kawase blur. Use the same flag above to target splash for exception.

### bspwm
Add the following rules to your `~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc`:

    # Splash Float
    bspc rule -a SPLASH:SPLASH state=floating
    bspc rule -a SPLASH:SPLASH border=off

This is necessary to make sure bspwm immediately floats splashes. Otherwise you get unintended behavior.

### i3 and i3-gaps
Both of these window managers do not support the EWMH specification for specifying a preferred order of floating windows (specifically `_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE` and `_NET_WM_STATE_BELOW`).

These DEs seemingly work with two separate layers of windows (tiled and floating). Therefore, the `--bg` and `--fg` options do not work as intended (splashes will be permanently on the floating window layer). Splashes will never "disappear" behind tiled windows. Splashes will conflict with other floating windows too, and not stay above or below other windows.

Additionally, i3 is not compatible with the Xfixes library and makes it difficult to disable user input / hover focus for the window, so the `--ni` flag will also not work. For some reason, i3 decides that a window with no input area has its entire area instead be it's border, so dragging on a splash after setting the `--ni` flag will instead resize it in a wonky way.

All other options work as intended.

If you never use other floating windows and use splash just for overlays, the program works as intended.

See also:

https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/3265

I am thinking of a work around but it's a bit of work and requires an even deeper dive into X than the EWMH spec.

Add this line to your i3 config to make splash semi-compatible (removes borders for windows of type splash, i.e. `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH`):

    # splash config       
    for_window [window_type="splash"] border pixel 0

The issues mentioned above will still persist, but splash will work for certain applications, and you can still get on-screen windowless opengl contexts as a floating window.

## Customization & How it Works

### config

I am currently working on a configuration system to make the display behavior more easily customizable.

Possible configuration options include color-schemes, transparency options and event triggers.

### Custom Mode

Currently, building custom execution modes requires knowledge of C++ and OpenGL. If you don't have the experience but you have an idea for a type of visualization you would like, let me know.

splash provides a "windowless"* OpenGL context and a system for modularized data visualization using small shader programs ("execution modes"), which have access to the piped-in data and user-input events.

    Note: An X11 window technically exists, it is just made "transparent" to the desktop.

A generic "program" base class is exposed to user input (piped data, commandline, X11 events). It contains an event handling callback and a rendering callback.

The program class is exposed to an OpenGL rendering context for visualization, as well as a number of utility classes that intuitively wrap boilerplate OpenGL (taken from [TinyEngine](https://github.com/weigert/TinyEngine) ).

By defining a derived class with specialized callbacks (and any additional desired members), arbitrary behavior can be achieved using the data piped in, on the "windowless" OpenGL window.

The derived classes are precompiled and placed into `~/.config/splash/exec` where they are found and linked by splash at run time.

You can build your own visualization programs by defining a custom derived class, compiling it and placing it in the `exec` folder. Check out the `program` folder for examples (as well as the makefile).

## Notes

### To-Do
- Proper configuration file system, to expose the programs to static user settings
- More well tested execution modes
  - Plotting methods
  - .obj file load and display
  - Particle system
- Dynamic data streams by active pipe listening

### Why?

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

*check out my dope desktop fidget spinner, man*

    splash fidget

### A terrible Idea

One could theoretically add a whole DearImGUI menu to your desktop using splash. Why? I don't know. But it's possible. Everyday I stray further from the light.

### Contributing
If you find this interesting and would like to contribute that would be awesome. A number of places where contributing would be nice:

  - Designing use cases for different execution modes
  - Testing portability for other window managers / desktop environments
